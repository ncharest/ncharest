- 👋 Hi, I’m @ncharest
- 👀 I’m interested in novel methods of modeling or representing data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning text simplification with NLP-based methods & innovative ways of quantifying and modeling complexity in genotype-phenotype mappings
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any of the above or anyone with interest in modeling financial data (particularly if you have access to high frequency data!)
- 📫 How to reach me: send an email to natemcharest@gmail.com
